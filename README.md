# 8085 Emulator in C++
The project is an 8085 emulator coded in C++. It mimics the working of various 8085 instructions. The emulator runs assembly language instructions and produces outputs similar to the one obtained while working on the individual microprocessor. You can dump the memory to the terminal by providing `-m` flag after the filename.

## Report
Detailed report of the working and supported instructions can be found in [Report](https://github.com/Shanta-11/8085-Emulator-in-C-/blob/main/8085_C%2B%2B_report_git.pdf)

## Make instructions
- Create a new folder named `object` in the root project directory.
- Execute `make`.

## Execution Instructions
Run the compiled binary and pass the file path with the assembly code as an argument.
